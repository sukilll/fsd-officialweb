SET content = '## Project Overview

This project involved developing a comprehensive iOS extension for the Edge browser, enabling seamless **Figma-to-code conversion** directly from mobile devices.

### Key Features Implemented

- **Clean Interface Design**: Built an intuitive and efficient list view to manage design exports
- **Real-time Sync**: Enabled synchronization between Figma designs and code output
- **Mobile Optimization**: Optimized for iOS platform with native performance

### Technical Highlights

```javascript
// Example code generation
const component = generateComponent(figmaNode);
export default component;
```

> "The extension significantly improved our design-to-development workflow, reducing conversion time by 70%."

### Results

- ✅ Seamless integration with existing workflows
- ✅ High-fidelity code generation
- ✅ Improved developer productivity
- ✅ Reduced time-to-market'

SET content = '## Reading Mode Migration Success

Successfully migrated Edge''s desktop reading mode from the original Web UI framework to the modern **WebUI2 architecture**, dramatically reducing manual development effort.

### Migration Challenges

The original reading mode had several limitations:
- Legacy codebase with technical debt
- Inconsistent UI patterns
- Performance bottlenecks
- Limited customization options

### Our Solution

We developed a comprehensive migration strategy:

```typescript
// Migration framework
class ReadingModeMigrator {
  async migrateComponent(component: LegacyComponent) {
    const modernComponent = this.transform(component);
    return this.validate(modernComponent);
  }
}
```

- Automated component conversion
- Bulk styling updates
- Preserved functionality integrity

#### **Enhanced User Experience**
- Faster page load times
- Better typography rendering
- Improved accessibility features
- Dark mode support

#### **Developer Benefits**
- Modern React patterns
- TypeScript implementation
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Documentation improvements

### Performance Improvements

The new reading mode delivers:
